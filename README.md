# static-sharing
A dumping ground for little webpages so I can share rich information in a pastebin/gist type style.

Ideally I would make a service similar to gist.io, however github pages is already a thing and would be more powerful.
So instead I'm using github pages and opting to use scripting to autopublish various self-contained HTML artifacts.
